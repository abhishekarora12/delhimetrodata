# DelhiMetroData
Delhi metro doesnt have an API, so i made this script which gets data from its website and puts only relevant things in a file which can be used by any app.

Instructions
------------
* ``Clone this project.``
* ``Make a directory named "files" in the same parent directory,  otherwise the script will give an error``
* ``Run delhimetrodata.py``
* ``Check the file metro_stations.txt``
