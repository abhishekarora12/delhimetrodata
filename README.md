# DelhiMetroData
Delhi metro doesnt have an API, so i made this script which gets data from its website and puts only relevant things in a file which can be used by any app.

Steps:
1. Clone this project.
2. Make a directory named files otherwise it will give an error, in the same parent directory.
3. Run delhimetrodata.py
4. Check the file metro_stations.txt
